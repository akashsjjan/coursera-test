                            Green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. 
                            In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model,
                            used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create 
                            all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical 
                            energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, 
                            including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.

                            During post-classical and early modern Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers and the gentry, 
                            while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of 
                            Commons are green while those in the House of Lords are red. It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture.
                            It is the historic color of Islam, representing the lush vegetation of Paradise. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags 
                            of nearly all Islamic countries.

                            In surveys made in American, European, and Islamic countries, green is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope, and envy.
                            In the European Union and the United States, green is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health,but in China and most of Asia, 
                            its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental
                            movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, 
                            some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, 
                            products. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States.

                            Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light. Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between 
                            roughly 585 and 620 nanometres. In painting and traditional colour theory, it is a secondary colour of pigments, created by mixing yellow and red. 
                            It is named after the fruit of the same name.

                            The orange colour of carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, oranges, and many other fruits and vegetables comes from carotenes, a type of photosynthetic pigment. 
                            These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants' growth. Similarly the hues of autumn leaves are 
                            from the same pigment after chlorophyll is removed.

                            In Europe and America, surveys show that orange is the colour most associated with amusement, the unconventional, extroverts, warmth, fire, energy, activity, danger, 
                            ste and aroma, the autumn and Allhallowtide seasons, as well as having long been the national color of the Netherlands and the House of Orange. It also serves as the 
                            political colour of Christian democracy political ideology and most Christian democratic political parties.
                            In Asia it is an important symbolic colour of Buddhism and Hinduism.

                            Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570–590 nm. 
                            It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and 
                            computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, 
                            corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. They absorb light energy and protect plants from photodamage.
                            Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon, due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet).

                            Because it was widely available, yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 
                            17,000 years old. Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs, then in the murals in Roman villas.
                            In the early Christian church, yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom, but it was also associated with Judas 
                            Iscariot and used to mark heretics. In the 20th century, Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star. In China, bright yellow was the color 
                            of the Middle Kingdom, and could be worn only by the emperor and his household; special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet.

                            According to surveys in Europe, Canada, and the United States, yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, humor, and spontaneity, 
                            but also with duplicity, envy, jealousy, avarice, and, in the U.S., cowardice. In Iran it has connotations of pallor/sickness, but also wisdom and connection.
                            In China and many Asian countries, it is seen as the color of happiness, glory, harmony and wisdom.

                            Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570–590 nm. 
                            It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and 
                            computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, 
                            corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. They absorb light energy and protect plants from photodamage.
                            Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon, due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet).

                            Because it was widely available, yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 
                            17,000 years old. Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs, then in the murals in Roman villas.
                            In the early Christian church, yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom, but it was also associated with Judas 
                            Iscariot and used to mark heretics. In the 20th century, Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star. In China, bright yellow was the color 
                            of the Middle Kingdom, and could be worn only by the emperor and his household; special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet.

                            According to surveys in Europe, Canada, and the United States, yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, humor, and spontaneity, 
                            but also with duplicity, envy, jealousy, avarice, and, in the U.S., cowardice. In Iran it has connotations of pallor/sickness, but also wisdom and connection.
                            In China and many Asian countries, it is seen as the color of happiness, glory, harmony and wisdom.
